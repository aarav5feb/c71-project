          <p> The debate is a contest between two speakers to show their abilities in an argument. Speakers who agree with the topic are known as “affirmatives.” While those who disagree are referred to as “negatives.” Similarly, it is also essential to follow a proper format in debate writing. On the other hand, debating builds greater confidence among people.</p>
